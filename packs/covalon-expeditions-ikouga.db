In time, Ikouga's technology grew and urban development expanded, with the city encompassing more and more of the original island with every passing year. A bustling sea port filled with experience sailors traveled to other islands to harvest more resources, further increasing the city's abundance, until the city expanded to the point where the entire original island had been covered by city - no original tropical forest remained.</p>\n<p>One day, the wind suddenly stopped in Ikouga. As a city dependent on resources from other islands, it quickly fell into chaos and anarchy. While victims of the Cataclysm in other corners of the world more commonly died to monster attacks, citizens of Ikouga passed due to civil violence or starvation. Some managed to escape by rowing, but most who tried to cross the ocean perished, either from running out of supplies during the journey or - in rare cases - being attacked by a sea monster.</p>\n<p>For more information on Ikouga, see its entry in the <a href=\"https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covalon Player's Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mission Overview</h2>\n<p>On the path to searching for the external sources of the Heart of the Maw's power, Covalon has sailed to Ikouga on a galley named <em>The North Star</em> with the goal of establishing a naval base of operations from which they can explore the rest of the world. On the last leg of the journey, disaster struck - an unknown creature from beneath the waves ransacked the ship, causing it to run aground on the shore of Ikouga and causing significant damage. Luckily, our heroes are not stranded - just before the journey began, the Heart of Terra produced a Seed and instructed adventurers to plant it in Ikouga. By doing so and performing a special ritual, the magical connection between the Seed and the Heart manifested into a permanent portal that allows instantaneous access between Covalon and the base camp at Ikouga. <em>The North Star</em> must be repaired before expeditions can continue, but we need to secure our camp in the meantime, and it might not hurt to explore the city and see what's been left behind.</p>\n<h2>How to Run an Expedition</h2>\n<p>Expeditions are composed of two subtypes: missions and [REDACTED]. Missions are a set of three dungeon-like adventures that are narratively linked, but can be completed in any order. Each mission must include predetermined narrative and mechanical elements while sticking to a theme of locations, creatures, and loot, which are included in its associated journal entry, with the specifics of the blanks to be filled in by the GM of the adventure. Like other adventure types, Dungeon Guides must submit their expedition missions for approval.</p>\n<p>When reading the instructions for an expedition, you may see key terms surrounded by number signs. These indicate that the term should be replaced by a value that's dependent on the adventure's average party level. When submitting your expedition for approval, you must include the values you plan to replace these terms with. Here is a list of terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>#Creature [Table Number] [Modifier]#</strong> should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995\">Building Creatures</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Creature 2-8 Minimum# means that you should reference the Building Creatures rules, look for Table 2-8, and use the value in the Minimum column for the party's average level.</li>\n<li><strong>#Hazard [Table Number] [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to a table in the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043\">Building Hazards</a> section of the Gamemastery Guide. For example, \"#Hazard 2-16 Simple Damage# means that you should reference the Building Hazards rules, look for table 2-16, and use the value in the Simple Damage column for the party's average level.</li>\n<li><strong>#DC [Modifier]# </strong>should be replaced by a value according to the <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCs by Level</a> table in the Core Rulebook. If a modifier is included, the value should be adjusted accordingly. For example, \"#DC +5#\" means that you should reference the DCs by Level table, find the value appropriate for the party's average level, then add 5 to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[REDACTED]</p>\n<h2>Reporting a Completed Expedition</h2>\n<p>When reporting a completed expedition in the Dungeon Summaries channel, use the <strong>exact name</strong> of the adventure as the adventure's title. For example, if you ran the first mission of Ikouga, the summary's title should be \"Ikouga Mission A: Retame the Island\" exactly. The summary should otherwise follow the same format as dungeons.</p>\n<p>Finally, any narrative-based knowledge or intrigue that the players gain as a result of the expedition should be left out of the summary.
